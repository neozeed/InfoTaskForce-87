# Compile options are described below:
#
# ALLOCALL : As originally coded, when the program allocated
#           memory it always made sure that there was always
#           25k left free. This is not a requirement in most
#           system. If this isn't a requirement on your system
#           then use this option.
# DEBUG    : Compile a debug version of the interpreter. Compare
#           output produced with this option against a working
#           debug version when you suspect problems in the
#           virtual machine [ this commonly produces error 21 ].
# TERMCAP  : Compile a version that uses termcap features for
#           terminal output. You may also have to include a
#           termcap library as well.
# TIMESEED : Seed the random number generator with time (). Use
#           this option if time () is available on you system.
#
#CFLAGS=		-O -DALLOCALL -DTIMESEED -DTERMCAP # -DDEBUG
CFLAGS=		-O -DALLOCALL -DTIMESEED

# If TERMCAP option defined include the termcap library here
# -ltermcap not required for Sys V.
